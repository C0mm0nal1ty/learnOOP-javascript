/*
1.Why use OOP?

It is used to model real-world objects(living things or innanimate things.)

2. 4 pillars of OOP are:
  - abstraction : hiding the details of how your object interacts
    simple model of a complex thing
  - inheritance : property where a subclass is a child of a parent class
  - encapsulation : packaging data inside an object
  - polymorphism : ability of many object types to have the same functionality
  -

3. Difference between class and object:
A class represents the model for an object.
The object is an instance of the model.

4. What are constructors?
These are methods/functions that are used to create an instance of a class.
These can be specified with parameters or no parameters
These are always capitalized.


5. What are destructors?
Methods of an object that carry out the destruction of the instance.
Usually, releasing the memory and dealing with any logic.
